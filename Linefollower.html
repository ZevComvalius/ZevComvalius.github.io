<p><b style='color:rgb(36, 36, 36)'>Using three light sensors, two servo motors and a FPGA module, this robot can follow a line on the ground autonomously. The code on the FPGA includes a clock, a controller, a buffer and motor controls. The benefit of using an FPGA is that it is very fast at performing a specific task, unlike a normal CPU which can do a lot of things moderately fast.</b></p>
